When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to work different boxes
When I want to collaborate with multiple users.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks -> This is done when you want to clone a github repo within github. On top of cloning, git hub maintains the 
count of number of people who forked from a parent repository

clones -> We can clone either a local repository or a remote repository to our local box. What ever changes we push 
would ideally go to the repository named origin. In this case it is the remote repository which we have just cloned.

Branch -> Branch is just a label for a particular checkin so that if want to get back to that checkin we can do so easily.
And the branch checkin would be the parent of subsequent childs. By switching branch we can go to a different logical point in code.
