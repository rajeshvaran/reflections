What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1. A new repository will be created so that we can commit the existing/future files/changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is where I manually save the file. This could be from any ide.
Repository is where the commits are added.
Staging area is the intermediate area where I move the files before commit so that I can choose which file to commit and add those
files alone to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Even though I can modify multiple files in the working area, I can choose which files to go as a part of a commit and move it
to staging area using git add command.
