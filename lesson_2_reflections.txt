What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1. A new repository will be created so that we can commit the existing/future files/changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is where I manually save the file. This could be from any ide.
Repository is where the commits are added.
Staging area is the intermediate area where I move the files before commit so that I can choose which file to commit and add those
files alone to commit.
